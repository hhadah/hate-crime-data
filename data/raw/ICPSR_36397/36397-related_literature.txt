This report presents National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data on
hate crime victimizations from 2005 to 2019. Hate crimes in the NCVS
include violent and property crimes that the victim perceived to be
motivated by bias against the victim's race, ethnicity, national origin,
gender, disability, sexual orientation, or religion. It includes crimes
reported and not reported to police. The report examines the number of hate
crimes over time, characteristics of hate crimes, perceived bias
motivations for these hate crimes, reporting to police and reasons hate
crimes were not reported, and demographic characteristics of victims and
offenders.

The Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as those 'that manifest
evidence of prejudice based on race, gender or gender identity, religion,
disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.' For the period 2004 to 2015,
U.S. residents experienced an average of 250,000 hate-crime victimizations
each year (0.7 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older). There was no
statistically significant change in the rate of violent hate-crime
victimizations during this period. During the aggregated period from 2011
to 2015, 48 percent of hate-crime victimization were motivated by racial
bias; 35 percent of victims believed they were victimized because of their
ethnicity or gender. Ninety percent of hate crimes in the period 2011-15
involved violence, and approximately 29 percent were serious violent crimes
(rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault). Fifty-four
percent of hate-crime victimization during this period were reported to
police. Males and females had similar rates of hate-crime victimization.
Hispanics experienced a higher rate of violent hate victimization than non-
Hispanic Whites. Persons in households in the lowest income bracket
($24,999 or less) had the highest rate of victimization compared to all
other income categories. 1 figure

This report presents data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Hate Crime
Statistics Program (HCSP) on hate crime incidents and victims from 2010 to
2019. The HCSP, which began in 1990, collects hate crime data regarding
criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias
against a race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation,
gender, or gender identity. The HCSP includes crimes reported to police
that, after investigation, reveal sufficient evidence to support being
recorded as hate crimes. The report examines incidents and victims of hate
crime recorded by law enforcement, trends over time in total hate crimes,
and hate crimes motivated by bias against the victim’s race, ethnicity, or
ancestry.

Statistics Program (HCSP) on hate crime incidents and victims from 2010 to
2019. The HCSP, which began in 1990, collects hate crime data regarding
criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias
against a race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation,
gender, or gender identity. The HCSP includes crimes reported to police
that, after investigation, reveal sufficient evidence to support being
recorded as hate crimes. The report examines incidents and victims of hate
crime recorded by law enforcement, trends over time in total hate crimes,
and hate crimes motivated by bias against the victim’s race, ethnicity, or
ancestry.
