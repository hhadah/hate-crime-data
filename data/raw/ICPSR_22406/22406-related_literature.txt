The Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as those 'that manifest
evidence of prejudice based on race, gender or gender identity, religion,
disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.' For the period 2004 to 2015,
U.S. residents experienced an average of 250,000 hate-crime victimizations
each year (0.7 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older). There was no
statistically significant change in the rate of violent hate-crime
victimizations during this period. During the aggregated period from 2011
to 2015, 48 percent of hate-crime victimization were motivated by racial
bias; 35 percent of victims believed they were victimized because of their
ethnicity or gender. Ninety percent of hate crimes in the period 2011-15
involved violence, and approximately 29 percent were serious violent crimes
(rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault). Fifty-four
percent of hate-crime victimization during this period were reported to
police. Males and females had similar rates of hate-crime victimization.
Hispanics experienced a higher rate of violent hate victimization than non-
Hispanic Whites. Persons in households in the lowest income bracket
($24,999 or less) had the highest rate of victimization compared to all
other income categories. 1 figure
